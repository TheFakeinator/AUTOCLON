# AUTOCLON
Welcome to the worst script ever, enjoy using it. (not affilated with grimtin10's autoclon)

The binds for it are **"ASJKL"** for the frets and **"ZX"** for up and downstrum with Extrarake.  
Make sure to rebind when you open the script, or else it doesn't work.  
> Would this work with my controller?  

No idea, I'm using joystick input for when the user rebinds. So whatever controller does joystick inputs should work.  
> Will this get me banned?  

I don't know, try it.  

> Can I contact you?  

Go ahead, you can find me (DJCyberCum228#6025) <-- here.

> Can I help on the project?  

If you find anything you can improve or are willing to do a python conversion (god help your soul), make sure to DM me. I'll be honored to add it to the github.
