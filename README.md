# AUTOCLON
A EZ way with a GUI to have more overtap and better rakes on GH controllers if modifying the hardware doesn't work out.
Uses Autohotkey v1.1

F.A.Q
q: Why doesn't this work with my controller?
a: Make sure you're using either a Les Paul or World Tour Wii Controller with a Raphnet adapter, After that open up "Setup USB Game Controllers" in Windows
and set the controller you're using as the preferred device in "Advanced" options. After all of that reopen the script, should work.

q: Will I get banned off of ScoreSpy using this?
a: Most likely, its not detected by the anti-cheat but we're not sure what information is shared when you send in a score. So use with caution!

q: What is Extrarake?
a: Basically if you send a input over the strum threshold it will send in an extra strum input every time.
